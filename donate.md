The [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/) website costs significant amounts of money to run. Throughout the years, I've received many offers for custom advertising and sponsor deals. But I've stubbornly held onto the conviction that **educational resources like mine should be 100% free and not beholden to advertisers, sponsors, or investors.**

In the end, the only funding model I'm comfortable with is one where generous people make donations to keep things free for everyone else. Here are some ways you can help:

- Use Patreon to make a <a class="donatelink" href="https://www.patreon.com/pgbovine" target="_blank">recurring monthly pledge</a>
- Use PayPal or your **credit/debit card** to give
